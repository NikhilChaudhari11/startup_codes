Github Commands
###

1)
git branch

~ This list all available branches

2)
git checkout main

~ This goes to the main. Make sure you always do this

3)
git checkout -b workingBranch

~ -b indicates that it is creating a new branch from main and naming it workingBranch (this is in CamelCase with the starting character small)

4)
git status

~ This tells if there is any difference between the files in the local folder and the files in the workingBranch

5)
git add .
OR
git add anyfile.py

~ This updates all files (if 'git add .' is used) from the local to workingBranch
~ This updates one file (if 'git add anyfile.py' is used) from the local to workingBranch

6)
git commit -m "some message regarding the update: make it descriptive"

~ This acts as "Save As" for workingBranch

7)
git push origin HEAD

~ This pushes workingBranch to the gates of main. A "Pull-Request" needs to be made from main to get these changes
